# DentFlow 

## Dental Clinic Network Management Software <br/>


DentFlow is an application developed by our 6-person team as the culmination of our year-long programming study at CodeCool. 

<br/>

It is an application that, in its current form, allows for the management of medical documentation for dental clinic patients, as well as scheduling and appointments. It is worth noting that from the perspective of dentists or supporting staff using DentFlow, only one user account needs to be created. Upon logging in, the user sees a list of all the clinics they are employed in and selects the one where they want to currently perform their duties. This solution is inspired by the gabinet.gov.pl portal introduced at the request of the Polish government, which allows medical personnel to work in multiple facilities using a single account.

<br/>

I was the initiator of this project, which is why I served as the product owner. Additionally, due to my contact with practicing dentists, most of DentFlow's functionalities correspond to real business requirements.

<br/>

In my opinion, the biggest challenge for our team during this project was that it was our first encounter with the Spring framework and the React library, which we were learning on the job. However, by dedicating a significant amount of time to learning and working, we managed to create a valuable application and gain experience in these technologies.
